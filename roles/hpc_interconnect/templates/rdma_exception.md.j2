# POA&M: InfiniBand RDMA Encryption Exception

## System

- Enclave: {{ hpc_interconnect_enclave_name }}
- Generated: {{ ansible_date_time.date | default('unknown-date') }}

## Exception Statement

InfiniBand RDMA traffic inside the CUI enclave compute fabric currently operates without in-network encryption.
This exception is documented until validated line-rate encryption is available in production hardware.

## Affected Controls

- NIST 800-171 Rev2: 3.13.8, 3.13.11
- NIST 800-171 Rev3: 03.13.08, 03.13.11

## Risk Assessment

Residual risk is accepted as **medium** due to constrained physical access and layered compensating controls.

## Milestones

1. Track vendor roadmap for in-network encryption support.
2. Validate performance and security test results in staging.
3. Transition from exception to enforced encryption policy.
