# Researcher Quickstart

_Audience: Researcher_

## Purpose
This document is generated from canonical YAML data models and stays consistent with the control mapping, glossary, HPC tailoring decisions, and ODP values.

## Researcher Onboarding
1. Request system access through approved account workflows.
2. Complete security training aligned with [NIST](glossary_full.md#term-nist) 800-171.
3. Use [MFA](glossary_full.md#term-mfa) when signing in.
4. Store project data in authorized enclaves handling [CUI](glossary_full.md#term-cui).

## Daily Practices
- **3.1.3**: This requirement protects [CUI](glossary_full.md#term-cui) in university research environments. Teams document implementation steps and apply automated checks when possible.
