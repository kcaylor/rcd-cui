  acceptance.
tailoring_decisions:
- tailoring_id: session-timeout-compute-nodes
  control_r2: 3.13.11
  control_r3: 03.13.11
  title: Session timeout on compute nodes
  standard_requirement: Terminate inactive sessions after a defined period.
  hpc_challenge: Long-running batch jobs often execute for days without interactive
    activity.
  tailored_implementation: Apply timeout controls to login nodes while allowing scheduler-managed
    compute sessions.
  compensating_controls:
  - Scheduler job ownership checks
  - Node isolation
  - Privileged session logging
  risk_acceptance: medium
  nist_800_223_reference: NIST SP 800-223 Section 4.2
  performance_impact: Low impact on throughput when enforced at access tier.
- tailoring_id: fips-cryptography-infiniband
  control_r2: 3.13.8
  control_r3: 03.13.08
  title: FIPS cryptography on InfiniBand
  standard_requirement: Use validated cryptography to protect confidentiality and
    integrity.
  hpc_challenge: Native InfiniBand encryption choices can reduce bandwidth and increase
    latency.
  tailored_implementation: Encrypt at storage and management planes while segmenting
    trusted compute fabric paths.
  compensating_controls:
  - Fabric segmentation
  - Host-based encryption
  - Strict key management
  risk_acceptance: medium
  nist_800_223_reference: NIST SP 800-223 Section 5.1
  performance_impact: Moderate overhead on fabric-level encryption.
- tailoring_id: audit-volume-compute-nodes
  control_r2: 3.3.1
  control_r3: 03.03.01
  title: Audit volume on compute nodes
  standard_requirement: Capture auditable events for security-relevant actions.
  hpc_challenge: Per-process logging at scale can overwhelm storage and analysis systems.
  tailored_implementation: Collect high-value events locally and forward sampled telemetry
    to SIEM pipelines.
  compensating_controls:
  - Centralized SIEM correlation
  - Immutable log archive
  risk_acceptance: low
  nist_800_223_reference: NIST SP 800-223 Section 6.3
  performance_impact: Low when selective event capture is used.
- tailoring_id: mfa-batch-jobs
  control_r2: 3.5.3
  control_r3: 03.05.03
  title: MFA for batch jobs
  standard_requirement: Use multifactor authentication for privileged and remote access.
  hpc_challenge: Non-interactive scheduler jobs cannot satisfy prompt-based MFA at
    execution time.
  tailored_implementation: Require MFA at job submission and use short-lived signed
    scheduler tokens for execution.
  compensating_controls:
  - Token expiration enforcement
  - Submission audit trail
  risk_acceptance: medium
  nist_800_223_reference: NIST SP 800-223 Section 4.5
  performance_impact: Minimal impact on users after submission.
- tailoring_id: multi-tenancy-isolation
  control_r2: 3.13.2
  control_r3: 03.13.02
  title: Multi-tenancy isolation
  standard_requirement: Separate user functionality from system management functionality.
  hpc_challenge: Shared nodes and accelerators increase tenant co-residency risk.
  tailored_implementation: Use scheduler partitioning, cgroup isolation, and network
    micro-segmentation.
  compensating_controls:
  - Dedicated partitions for high sensitivity workloads
  - GPU reset automation
  risk_acceptance: medium
  nist_800_223_reference: NIST SP 800-223 Section 5.4
  performance_impact: Moderate due to reduced packing efficiency.
- tailoring_id: container-security
  control_r2: 3.4.8
  control_r3: 03.04.08
  title: Container security on shared clusters
  standard_requirement: Apply configuration restrictions to prevent unauthorized software
    behavior.
  hpc_challenge: Researchers need portable containers that may include privileged
    runtime options.
  tailored_implementation: Require signed container images and enforce runtime policy
    profiles.
  compensating_controls:
  - Image scanning
  - Admission policy checks
  risk_acceptance: low
  nist_800_223_reference: NIST SP 800-223 Section 7.1
  performance_impact: Low with pre-cache and signed image workflows.
- tailoring_id: parallel-filesystem-acls
  control_r2: 3.1.3
  control_r3: 03.01.03
  title: Parallel filesystem ACL enforcement
  standard_requirement: Control information flow according to policy.
  hpc_challenge: High-throughput filesystems may not support enterprise ACL semantics
    uniformly.
  tailored_implementation: Use project-level RBAC and data domain separation with
    periodic entitlement reviews.
  compensating_controls:
  - Automated entitlement reports
  - Quarterly access recertification
  risk_acceptance: medium
  nist_800_223_reference: NIST SP 800-223 Section 5.7
  performance_impact: Low for most workflows.
- tailoring_id: long-running-job-management
  control_r2: 3.13.12
  control_r3: 03.13.12
  title: Long-running job management
  standard_requirement: Protect sessions and terminate orphaned activity.
  hpc_challenge: Scientific jobs may require uninterrupted runtimes over extended
    windows.
  tailored_implementation: Use scheduler heartbeat checks and owner re-validation
    for prolonged jobs.
  compensating_controls:
  - Job checkpointing
  - Owner attestation for extended runtime
  risk_acceptance: medium
  nist_800_223_reference: NIST SP 800-223 Section 4.8
  performance_impact: Low with scheduler-native controls.
- tailoring_id: gpu-memory-sanitization
  control_r2: 3.8.3
  control_r3: 03.08.03
  title: GPU memory sanitization
  standard_requirement: Sanitize media before reuse.
  hpc_challenge: GPU memory can retain residual data across workload boundaries.
  tailored_implementation: Trigger secure GPU memory reset hooks between tenant allocations.
  compensating_controls:
  - Node health checks
  - Scheduler drain on sanitize failure
  risk_acceptance: low
  nist_800_223_reference: NIST SP 800-223 Section 7.4
  performance_impact: Small per-allocation delay.

  control_r2: 3.4.1
  control_r3: 03.04.01
  title: Node provisioning via PXE
  standard_requirement: Maintain baseline configurations with controlled changes.
  hpc_challenge: Rapid node reprovisioning relies on network boot workflows vulnerable
    to tampering.
  tailored_implementation: Use signed images, isolated provisioning networks, and
    measured boot attestations.
  compensating_controls:
  - Provisioning network ACLs
  - Image signature verification
  - Attestation logs
  risk_acceptance: low
  nist_800_223_reference: NIST SP 800-223 Section 6.1
  performance_impact: Low with cached trusted images.
