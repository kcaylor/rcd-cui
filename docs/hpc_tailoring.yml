tailoring_decisions:
  - tailoring_id: session-timeout-compute-nodes
    control_r2: 3.13.11
    control_r3: 03.13.11
    title: Session timeout on compute nodes
    standard_requirement: Terminate inactive sessions after a defined period.
    hpc_challenge: Long-running batch jobs often execute for days without interactive activity.
    tailored_implementation: Session timeout enforcement remains on access/login paths while scheduler-managed compute execution is controlled by Slurm partition policy and job ownership checks.
    compensating_controls:
      - Scheduler job ownership checks
      - Node isolation
      - Privileged session logging
    risk_acceptance: medium
    nist_800_223_reference: NIST SP 800-223 Section 4.2
    performance_impact: Low impact on throughput when enforced at access tier.
  - tailoring_id: fips-cryptography-infiniband
    control_r2: 3.13.8
    control_r3: 03.13.08
    title: FIPS cryptography on InfiniBand
    standard_requirement: Use validated cryptography to protect confidentiality and integrity.
    hpc_challenge: Native InfiniBand encryption choices can reduce bandwidth and increase latency.
    tailored_implementation: Exception and compensating-control documentation is generated by hpc_interconnect role templates while enclave boundary encryption remains enforced at storage and management planes.
    compensating_controls:
      - Fabric segmentation
      - Host-based encryption
      - Strict key management
    risk_acceptance: medium
    nist_800_223_reference: NIST SP 800-223 Section 5.1
    performance_impact: Moderate overhead on fabric-level encryption.
  - tailoring_id: audit-volume-compute-nodes
    control_r2: 3.3.1
    control_r3: 03.03.01
    title: Audit volume on compute nodes
    standard_requirement: Capture auditable events for security-relevant actions.
    hpc_challenge: Per-process logging at scale can overwhelm storage and analysis systems.
    tailored_implementation: High-value events are captured in Slurm prolog/epilog and container wrapper logs, then collected via role evidence tasks and SSP evidence playbook aggregation.
    compensating_controls:
      - Centralized SIEM correlation
      - Immutable log archive
    risk_acceptance: low
    nist_800_223_reference: NIST SP 800-223 Section 6.3
    performance_impact: Low when selective event capture is used.
  - tailoring_id: mfa-batch-jobs
    control_r2: 3.5.3
    control_r3: 03.05.03
    title: MFA for batch jobs
    standard_requirement: Use multifactor authentication for privileged and remote access.
    hpc_challenge: Non-interactive scheduler jobs cannot satisfy prompt-based MFA at execution time.
    tailored_implementation: Onboarding assigns Duo policy to project groups and offboarding removes group access while Slurm jobs run under account controls after authenticated submission.
    compensating_controls:
      - Token expiration enforcement
      - Submission audit trail
    risk_acceptance: medium
    nist_800_223_reference: NIST SP 800-223 Section 4.5
    performance_impact: Minimal impact on users after submission.
  - tailoring_id: multi-tenancy-isolation
    control_r2: 3.13.2
    control_r3: 03.13.02
    title: Multi-tenancy isolation
    standard_requirement: Separate user functionality from system management functionality.
    hpc_challenge: Shared nodes and accelerators increase tenant co-residency risk.
    tailored_implementation: Dedicated CUI partition uses EXCLUSIVE scheduling with post-job memory sanitization and health checks to prevent unsafe node reuse.
    compensating_controls:
      - Dedicated partitions for high sensitivity workloads
      - GPU reset automation
    risk_acceptance: medium
    nist_800_223_reference: NIST SP 800-223 Section 5.4
    performance_impact: Moderate due to reduced packing efficiency.
  - tailoring_id: container-security
    control_r2: 3.4.8
    control_r3: 03.04.08
    title: Container security on shared clusters
    standard_requirement: Apply configuration restrictions to prevent unauthorized software behavior.
    hpc_challenge: Researchers need portable containers that may include privileged runtime options.
    tailored_implementation: hpc_container_security deploys Apptainer policy and apptainer-cui wrapper enforcing signature verification, bind allowlist, and network isolation with controlled InfiniBand passthrough.
    compensating_controls:
      - Image scanning
      - Admission policy checks
    risk_acceptance: low
    nist_800_223_reference: NIST SP 800-223 Section 7.1
    performance_impact: Low with pre-cache and signed image workflows.
  - tailoring_id: parallel-filesystem-acls
    control_r2: 3.1.3
    control_r3: 03.01.03
    title: Parallel filesystem ACL enforcement
    standard_requirement: Control information flow according to policy.
    hpc_challenge: High-throughput filesystems may not support enterprise ACL semantics uniformly.
    tailored_implementation: hpc_storage_security deploys ACL sync daemon, filesystem-specific changelog configs, and quota policy artifacts to keep project access aligned with FreeIPA groups.
    compensating_controls:
      - Automated entitlement reports
      - Quarterly access recertification
    risk_acceptance: medium
    nist_800_223_reference: NIST SP 800-223 Section 5.7
    performance_impact: Low for most workflows.
  - tailoring_id: long-running-job-management
    control_r2: 3.13.12
    control_r3: 03.13.12
    title: Long-running job management
    standard_requirement: Protect sessions and terminate orphaned activity.
    hpc_challenge: Scientific jobs may require uninterrupted runtimes over extended windows.
    tailored_implementation: Offboarding blocks new submissions immediately and uses grace-period evidence markers for active jobs while Slurm partition controls keep execution attributed to project accounts.
    compensating_controls:
      - Job checkpointing
      - Owner attestation for extended runtime
    risk_acceptance: medium
    nist_800_223_reference: NIST SP 800-223 Section 4.8
    performance_impact: Low with scheduler-native controls.
  - tailoring_id: gpu-memory-sanitization
    control_r2: 3.8.3
    control_r3: 03.08.03
    title: GPU memory sanitization
    standard_requirement: Sanitize media before reuse.
    hpc_challenge: GPU memory can retain residual data across workload boundaries.
    tailored_implementation: Slurm epilog performs GPU reset with nvidia-smi and drains nodes automatically when reset fails, preserving evidence in CUI audit logs.
    compensating_controls:
      - Node health checks
      - Scheduler drain on sanitize failure
    risk_acceptance: low
    nist_800_223_reference: NIST SP 800-223 Section 7.4
    performance_impact: Small per-allocation delay.
  - tailoring_id: node-provisioning-pxe
    control_r2: 3.4.1
    control_r3: 03.04.01
    title: Node provisioning via PXE
    standard_requirement: Maintain baseline configurations with controlled changes.
    hpc_challenge: Rapid node reprovisioning relies on network boot workflows vulnerable to tampering.
    tailored_implementation: hpc_node_lifecycle deploys first-boot compliance scan, quarantine flags, and reusable health/sanitization scripts to gate node participation in production partitions.
    compensating_controls:
      - Provisioning network ACLs
      - Image signature verification
      - Attestation logs
    risk_acceptance: low
    nist_800_223_reference: NIST SP 800-223 Section 6.1
