# PI Guide

_Audience: Principal Investigator_

## Purpose
This document is generated from canonical YAML data models and stays consistent with the control mapping, glossary, HPC tailoring decisions, and ODP values.

## What You Need To Know
For Principal Investigators, the first priority is protecting [CUI](glossary_full.md#term-cui) and ensuring research teams follow approved handling workflows.
