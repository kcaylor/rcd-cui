# Welcome to the CUI HPC Environment

Hello {{ pi_name | default(pi_username) }},

Your project **{{ project_name }}** (`{{ project_id }}`) is now onboarded for CUI processing.

## Plain-language summary

Your team can now run jobs in a protected cluster area designed for CUI work. Access is limited to approved users, and security checks run automatically before and after each job.

## What your team must do

1. Complete and keep CUI training current.
2. Use Duo MFA for all cluster access.
3. Submit jobs to the `{{ cui_partition | default('cui') }}` partition with account `{{ slurm_account }}`.
4. Keep project data under `{{ project_storage_path }}`.
5. Use signed containers when running container workflows.

## What the system does automatically

- Verifies user authorization before job start
- Logs CUI job and container events for audit evidence
- Sanitizes temporary memory areas when jobs end
- Enforces storage ACLs and project quotas

## Common commands

```bash
sbatch --partition={{ cui_partition | default('cui') }} --account={{ slurm_account }} job.sh
apptainer-cui run /cui/containers/approved-image.sif
```
